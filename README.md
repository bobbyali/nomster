This is the git repo for the second site that I developed whilst doing [The Firehose Project](http://www.firehoseproject.com), an online Ruby on Rails bootcamp. The tutorial was designed to produce [this "Nomster" locations database site](http://nomster.herokuapp.com). My final product is [this site that shows places that I've visited with my son](http://london.adamand.me).

The third standalone project I developed for the bootcamp can be found [here](https://github.com/bobbyali/flixster). I also worked on a group chess project which can be found [here](https://github.com/theFirehoseProject/chess).
